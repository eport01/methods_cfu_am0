# Self Evaluation

- How confident do you feel about your use of built-in Ruby methods?

I'm definitely feeling more comfortable with these methods as time goes on. It's going to be interesting to see which methods we use all the time and which ones we will have to look up.

- How confident do you feel writing simple methods of your own?

I feel pretty good about writing simple methods. I can imagine it can get a little more complicated and confusing but simple ones seem ok for now.

- What questions do you have about methods, and what they are capable of? (ask a question!!!)

Can you include if statements in a method? What are the most helpful methods to memorize?
