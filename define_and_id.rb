# Run each line of code below (either from this file or in IRB individually).
#  Then, in a ruby comment, write 1-2 sentences describing what is happening, using ALL the involved vocabulary terms you've learned in this lesson so far.

# EXAMPLE
# The downcase method is called on the string object "Hello World"
# No arguments are passed; downcase has one clear job which is to lowercase all letters that exist in the String
# The return value is "hello world"
"Hello World".downcase

# YOU DO the rest:


"Hello World".include?("Hello")
#true. checks if the string "Hello" exists

"Hello World".end_with?("Hello")
#false. Checks if it ends with Hello

"Hello World".end_with?("rld")
#true. Checks if it ends with "rld"

12.even?
# true, checks if the number is even


18.next
# 19, checks for the next integer. prints the next integer.
